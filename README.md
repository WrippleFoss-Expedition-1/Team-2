# Food Vision

> Food Vision aims to determine the freshness of the food items.    

## Overview  

Food is something related to our health and is prior to anything else. Ever since the quality of foods is degrading everywhere, there is a huge demand for high quality foods.  Freshness is one of the major contributors to the high quality food. Something that can determine the freshness of food items is needed, so that customers or users could detect the freshness of food they are having and act accordingly. Food Vision comes to rescue for this problem.  

Food Vision is an app through which people can scan food items through their cell phones and the app will determine the freshness of that scanned food item.  

## Motivation  

Food is essential for human sustainability. It is very important to have good food. Fresh food to be precise. There are numerous restaurants, lunchrooms, canteens, etc that have set examples of providing bad quality food to customers. Food is such a thing, which can't be compromised, as it directly concerns our health and body metabolism. Testing food at each and every place is something can't possible for the customers. Keeping in mind the end users, Our mission is to come up with a solution that targets customers to have the power to judge food.
